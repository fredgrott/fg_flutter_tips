# Adaptive Tips

The new responsive and adaptive technique is to use the Material IO team's adaptive scaffold for both the adaptive and responsive parts of the app as a shared scaffold.

These are the typical use cases encountered when using the Adaptive Scaffold library.

Note, Google often combines responsive and adaptive together and 
the flutter adaptive scaffold is one example of that combined responsive adaptive approach.
