1. mobile listview tablet desk girdview demo with gorouter
2. mobile 2 column tbalet desk 3 or more columns with gorouter
3. custom adaptive scaff pattern using adaptive layout,
   google always shows it wrong in not wrapping it
   in a scaffold
   see adaptive layout source to emulate

Junior Google Flutter SDK team members always 
take the no other dependencies in package demo
too literal resulting in showing the
example with a wrong assumption and wrong implementation

Feed Widget
Panel
Master Detail
Mobile listView and other gird view

all need to be statefuls as vm is passed 
at root of stateful for state to access as widget.name
and the display detail part would have to 
be an indexstack

Feed
  -3 expanded, 2, compact 1
  -2 column in non compact in compact its stacked
  - implemented grid layout of cards

List Detail-this one last as it has some special foldable transtions which 
      we do not implement secondbody to handle but handle in the layout polling
      the foldable angle stuff
   compact is stacked
   non compact list left side detail right side
  as indexed stack

Supporting Pane
      main body 80%
      supporting right content 20
      does not have a parent child relationship like list detial

     compact support pane is below main body
     medium support pane is below main body
     expanded support pane is to right of main body

do skeleton app as adaptive layout demo
than sample list view morphs into
feed, list, and supporting pane
