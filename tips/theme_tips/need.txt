flutter sdk still has dep of mcu 0.2
where as new scheme palettes come in mcu 0.5 such
as content, etc. all matching android kotlin java side.

So general idea is since FCS and FSS are linked
to internal copy of mcu 0.5 need extra 
code to build schemes and go forward

I should also do a manual set where
I tie the flutter sdk to a mcu 0.6 override
and do manual schemes manual dynamic color
and themes as a base line
