# FG Flutter Tips

Due to Google developing 3 front-ends with 3 different front end SDK teams we have a situation where it's just as important to know some 3rd party libraries that are outside the Flutter SDK.

These tips cover usage techniques that one can use with those 3rd party libraries. Not even the GDE stars cover these aspects of using the Flutter SDK.

## Why

The way I have to develop both article content and book chapter content is to write articles focused around libraries and components with main core use case first. And then fill out the other use cases.

Thus, generally code wise, I do that code here in this repo and 
than that gets expanded to book code repos. So, yes these are somewhat useful units of use cases to learn flutter development and design techniques from at the moment as I flesh out and build the book code repos.
